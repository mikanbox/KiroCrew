    The cron executor resets its agent session the moment the run finishes, so
    by the time the user opens the injected ``cron-{id}`` slot there is no
    resident provider for the slot-detail open path to read and no snapshot
    either — ``broadcast_context_usage`` (the meter's single writer) is only
    reached by dashboard-driven turns. The bar therefore rendered 0% for a
    session with a full transcript. This helper captures the reading while the
    provider is still alive; :func:`inject_cron_result_to_dashboard` routes it
    through the single writer so the open path serves it like any other
    cold-session snapshot.

    Mirrors ``chat_runner._context_usage_payload``'s accessor discipline: the
    provider's PUBLIC accessors only (``last_prompt_stats`` lives on the inner
    AcpClient and would always miss on the pooled provider), and token counts
    ship only when both are measured — ``used == 0`` means "not measured", and
    asserting a false "0 / W tokens" is worse than omitting the pair.

    Returns ``None`` when nothing was measured (``pct <= 0``): a provider that
    just ran a turn always occupies context (the prompt itself), so a
    zero/absent pct here means "not reported", never "measured empty" — the
    same contract as ``_context_reading`` on the read side. Skipping the write
    also deliberately preserves an earlier run's real snapshot rather than
    overwriting it with an unmeasured zero (which would recreate the 0%-bar
    symptom this helper exists to fix); the genuine post-compaction 0% reset
    frame is emitted by the session manager's compact callback for live
    sessions, not by this capture path. Never raises — this feeds best-effort
    display state and must not fail the cron delivery that calls it.

    formatting and no timezone lookup: the stamp is part of the row's dedup key,

    differently and append a duplicate instead of collapsing onto it.

    stamp made resolution load-bearing -- at minutes, two runs in one minute with
    identical output collapsed; at seconds, two runs in one second still did. The
    bound moves but never closes, because a stamp is written for a person to read
    and a person does not need microseconds.

    So identity stops riding on the display string. This marker carries the run's
    own ``last_result_ts`` at full precision, and the stamp is free to stay
    human-readable. An HTML comment because it must not render: the tab shows the

    * No VERBATIM prompt row survives in the slot -- a reference points at a row

    ``history`` is the ``cron:{id}`` transcript, hydrated into the slot the first
    time this binds one. It is REQUIRED and has no default on purpose: this
    function is synchronous and every caller is async, so a default would let a
    caller silently hand the whole-transcript parse back to the event loop --
    the defect issue #7408 fixed at five sites, four of which were exactly that
    omission. Without a default, forgetting it is a ``TypeError`` at the call,
    not a stall in production. Async callers get the value from
    :func:`prefetch_cron_history`; a sync caller must read it itself and own the
    blocking cost.

    ``None`` is legal and means "the injection will not need it" -- the state
    :func:`prefetch_cron_history` skips its read in. It cannot mean a lost
    hydration, because the only state that consumes ``history`` is an unlinked
    slot, and the sole writer of ``linked_session_key`` for a cron slot is the
    line below, which runs in this same synchronous block.

    Writes the run as a PAIR: the job's own prompt as a ``user`` row, then the
    result as an ``assistant`` row, both headed by :func:`run_stamp`. The
    executor streams the prompt straight to the provider and never persists it,
    so a follow-up turn used to replay a stack of results with nothing saying
    what any of them had been asked -- it could not tell which run the person in
    front of it was answering. The pair is written only when the run produced a
    result, so neither row can appear without its counterpart.

    ``include_prompt`` is False for a caller that is RE-SURFACING an older
    result rather than delivering a fresh one (``/to-chat``). Only the run that
    produced the result knows the prompt that produced it: ``job.message`` is
    live configuration a user can edit afterwards, so a re-surfacing caller
    reading it would pair the stored output with an instruction that never ran.
    Such a caller writes the result row alone -- the pre-existing behaviour --
    and any prompt row the executor already wrote is still in the history it
    hydrates from.

    ``context_reading`` is the run's context-meter reading captured by
    :func:`context_meter_reading` while the cron's provider was still resident.
    When present it is routed through ``broadcast_context_usage`` — the meter's
    single writer — so an open tab updates live and the slot-detail open path
    can serve it after the executor resets the session. ``None`` (the to-chat
    replay path, or a run that measured nothing) records nothing and keeps
    whatever snapshot an earlier run stored.
