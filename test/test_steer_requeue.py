"""Tests for the steer-loss fix: unconsumed mid-turn steers are requeued.

A steer handed to kiro-cli lives inside the running turn; if the turn dies
before kiro-cli echoes ``steering_consumed`` (stall-cancel, soft STOP, error,
or a steer racing the turn's natural end) the message used to vanish silently
(2026-07-17 incident). The fix tracks pending steers on the slot:

  * the steer handler registers in ``slot._pending_steers`` BEFORE the steer
    RPC's await (unwound on failure), so a turn dying mid-write still sees it;
  * ``EVENT_STEER_CONSUMED`` settles pending steers matched against the echo's
    ``<user_message>``-wrapped snapshot (late arrivals stay pending; an empty
    echo falls back to settling all);
  * ``_run_chat``'s finally requeues leftovers at the HEAD of the slot queue
    as ordinary, individually-cancellable queue cards (``queue_push``);
  * a hard kill (force stop) discards pending steers alongside the queue —
    mirroring the existing "second press = discard everything" semantics.

    `steer()` returning proves only that the backend has the bytes. A steer is

    echoes no `steering_consumed`, the teardown requeues the message, and it runs
    as its own turn. The row used to claim a successful mid-turn injection from
    write-ack alone, so that path rendered "steered into the running turn" for a
    turn that was never redirected (#7246).

    These assert the wire values as LITERALS on purpose. Importing the state

    The teardown requeue MOVES the delivery id out of `_steer_delivery_ids` and
    into the new queue entry's meta. If the user then cancels that card before the
    steer RPC resumes, the id is in neither place and no row was ever written --
    which looks exactly like the running turn having consumed the steer.

    A natural stage end requeues without touching `_stop_generation`, so this
    arrives with `stopped` false. Before the fix the not-stopped path never
    consulted the delivery-id map and fell through to the persisting tail,
    writing a transcript row for text the user had explicitly cancelled.
